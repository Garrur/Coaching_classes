# Uploaded Videos

This directory stores videos uploaded through the admin panel.

**Important:** In production, you should:
- Use a CDN like Cloudflare Stream, AWS S3, or similar
- Add this folder to `.gitignore` to avoid committing large files
- Implement proper video security (signed URLs)

For development, this local storage works perfectly!
